/*
PROBLEMS/ISSUES/ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT
- Ben is going to drop little TODO notes on things he's planning to work on soon. Feel free to work on those or not as you like, just remove the TODO if you finish it off.

- double click/pressing space bar do change the orientation, but the highlighted cells/selected answer doesn't change until a new click
- arrow keys cannot select answer
- Blocking a lettered square or lettering a block square, does not work symmetrically
- Too many columns extend beyond area
- sometimes, not always: can't select a cell that has a letter in it
